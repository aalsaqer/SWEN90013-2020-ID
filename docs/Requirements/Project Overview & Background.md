# Project Overview & Background

Description
================================================================================
About my relationship' is a healthy relationship tool and safety decision aid for women who have experienced domestic violence. 

The project in its current form is a web-portal with interview-style questions which participants fill in, and then are given an analysis of the health of their relationship. There are additional surveys which a user can then take to get further insights into the types of behaviours they value.

The current website link: http://idecide.org.au/

iDecide is headed by Professor Kelsey Hegarty (Professor at University of Melbourne). The website itself was built by a company in the US, and components of it may be subject to copyright/ownership issues. The website is hosted by and modified by the creator, and data is sent from creator back to Kelsey when required manually.

Stakeholder Information
================================================================================

+ Kelsey Hegarty (Project Owner): Professor interested in Family Violence, and done research and address about domestic family violence in last 20 years, recently moved online.
+ Laura: Academic worker in partnership with Kelsey
+ Additional academics at the university interested in using the data collected: The data produced by the site is used by researchers who are interested in family/domestic violence.
+ Website target demographic/users: Women who are experiencing domestic abuse or violence, and have access to the internet via a smartphone of computer. Of these women:
   + 11% are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
   + 20% were culturally diverse
   + Most are educated (Passed grade 12) 
   +  Many use libraries/public spaces to access the site so that the site is not in their history etc (Desktop usage is important)
   +  Research council: Originally funded the site development (Not as involved at this stage, since the grant is completed)
   +  Possibly other organisations interested in extending the platform or using as a basis for new projects, eg the Victorian government (possibility of extending for use as a self-assessment tool, front-risk assessment for women)


System-As-Is vs Ideal System
================================================================================
| Problems with -system-as-is         | Features of Ideal system         |
| ----------------------------------- |:-------------------------------:| 
| Several problems with the current system-as-is were identified during client interviews: 
|+ The current Desktop website uses older web-design styles, including in particular the need for many clickthroughs as part of the process rather than scrolling.





| + Kelsey) Survey results were previously provided by the software engineer, ideally, Kelsey will have direct access to the information. + (Kelsey, Orgs interested in adapting program) Complete and transparent ownership of the project and the codebase. + (Kelsey, Orgs interested in adapting program) Allow for future expansion of platform (Addition of more modules/questions). + (Kelsey) Ability to easily add content such as new questions, or modify the algorithm
| + (Users) Secure, safe and private platform.
+ (Users) More modern interface with:
   + Fewer 'clickthroughs' (ie more scrolling rather than hitting 'next').
   + Mobile-friendly sit.
   + More multimedia: eg add short videos (survivor videos, ~ 2 mins) to make the website more interactive (tentative), or short audios for those who do not want their pictures appear in the videos|
