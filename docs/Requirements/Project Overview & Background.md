# Project Overview & Background

Description
================================================================================
About my relationship' is a healthy relationship tool and safety decision aid for women who have experienced domestic violence. 

The project in its current form is a web-portal with interview-style questions which participants fill in, and then are given an analysis of the health of their relationship. There are additional surveys which a user can then take to get further insights into the types of behaviours they value.

The current website link: http://idecide.org.au/

iDecide is headed by Professor Kelsey Hegarty (Professor at University of Melbourne). The website itself was built by a company in the US, and components of it may be subject to copyright/ownership issues. The website is hosted by and modified by the creator, and data is sent from creator back to Kelsey when required manually.
