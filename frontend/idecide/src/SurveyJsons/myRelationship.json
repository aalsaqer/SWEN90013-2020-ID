Generally, a\n  healthy relationship involves:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Mutual trust and shared power</li>\n  <li>Support and open communicarion</li>\n  <li>Commitment and honesty</li>\n</ul>\nAn unhealthy relationship involves:\n<ul>\n  <li>Unsupportive behaviour</li>\n  <li>Misuse of power and authority</li>\n  <li>Pain, fear or harm</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  Most couples have arguments and fights, but this does not necessarily mean\n  your relationship is unhealthy. However , when one person is feeling unsafe or\n  afraid in the relationship, this is usually a sign that there are serious\n  problems. It is a good idea to regularly assess your relationship using the\n  scales below.\n</p>",
