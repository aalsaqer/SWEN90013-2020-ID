    "strategyHtml": "<p>If you separate from your partner, you will need to make decisions about how you both will care for any children you have together. You need a written \"parenting plan\" that outlines how you will share responsibilities and time with the child/ren.</p><p>If you and your partner agree on how you are going to parent your child/ren, you can draw up a parenting plan without the assistance of a lawyer. However, if your partner does not follow the agreement the court cannot enforce it.</p><p>If you and your partner do not agree, or if you prefer to have an agreement that can be enforced, you can apply to the Family Law Court (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.familycourt.gov.au\">www.familycourt.gov.au</a> for a parenting order. Normally, you must make a genuine effort to resolve the matter through mediation and obtain a certificate before you can apply for a parenting order. However, in cases of domestic violence an exception can often be made so that you do not have to make contact with your partner.</p><p>Judges make decisions about parenting orders based on what they think is in the best interests of your child. You will have to explain to the judge your situation and any safety concerns you may have for your child. Some partners use the children against the other partner. It is important to prepare for this.

In the meantime you can get interim (temporary) court orders. If your partner disobeys the parenting order, you can go to court and ask the judge to enforce the order. Police cannot enforce a parenting order.</p><p>You also have a right to child support payments from your partner. This is the money that one parent pays to the other parent to help provide for the daily needs of the children. Child support orders are made based on Federal child support guidelines. You can make an estimate of child support money by using an online child support calculator (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.humanservices.gov.au/customer/subjects/child-support-basics\">here</a>). It is important to contact the Department of Human Services (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.humanservices.gov.au\">www.humanservices.gov.au</a>) as soon as you separate as you will also be eligible for Family Support and/or Single Parent Payments.</p>"

Consider buying a prepaid mobile phone or another mobile phone that your partner doesn't know about. &nbsp;Check your phone settings. &nbsp;Your partner can use your mobile phone as a tracking device if it has GPS. Consider turning your phone off when not in use or leaving it behind if and when you choose to leave.</li><li>Save important/emergency contacts with anonymous names.</li></ul><p><strong>Smartphones&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Your partner may be able to track you through your smartphone if they have installed a tracking application. Tracking apps are hard to spot as they can be completely hidden. Remember that most phones can't be tracked when they're turned completely off. <strong>The safest option is to stop using your smartphone and purchase a prepaid mobile phone or another mobile phone that your partner&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;know about.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Safety on social media. (Twitter, Facebook, blogs, etc).</strong></p><ul><li>Erase anything on your profile that says where you live. Set your profile to private and don't add anyone as a friend if you don't know them.</li><li>Don't tweet or post status updates about your location.</li><li>Don't post your phone number online.</li><li>Make sure there are no geotagged photos of you on Facebook or other web sites. A geotagged photo has information about where the picture was taken. Check your own photos and photos friends have posted. Even if your profile is private, photos of you may be public if they were posted by someone else.</li><li>If you're using Twitter, make sure the &ldquo;Tweet With My Location&rdquo; setting is off.</li><li>Educate people in your life about the safety risks an abusive partner poses to you. Explain how your partner can use social networks to gather information. Ask them not to post anything to your accounts that gives information on your location. Tell them not to give out e-mail, phone or address information. Ask them to get a name and number so you can return the call.</li></ul>"

Jealousy is not love and can soon make you feel alone, afraid or unsafe.Ã‚Â </p><p></p><p>Jealous partners sometimes tell women: \"If I can't have you, no one can\". Take these types of comments seriously. Highly controlling partners who are also jealous may be dangerous when the relationship is threatened. This can happen when a woman plans to leave or has separated from her partner. They may stalk, harass or abuse their partners in other ways. </p><p></p><p>Call 1800-RESPECT (1800 737 732) or your local domestic violence support service to talk about your partner's jealousy.
