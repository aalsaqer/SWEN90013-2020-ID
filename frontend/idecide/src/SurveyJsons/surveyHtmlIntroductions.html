<h3>My Relationship Health</h3>
<p>
  This section of I-DECIDE walks you through some questions and activities to
  help you think about the health of your relationship with the partner or
  ex-partner who has made you feel afraid or unsafe.
</p>
<h4>What is a healthy relationship?</h4>
<p>
  Sometimes, it can be difficult to tell Whether a relationship is healthy or
  unhealthy because we docs't have anything to compare it to. Generally, a
  healthy relationship involves:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mutual trust and shared power</li>
  <li>Support and open communicarion</li>
  <li>Commitment and honesty</li>
</ul>
An unhealthy relationship involves:
<ul>
  <li>Unsupportive behaviour</li>
  <li>Misuse of power and authority</li>
  <li>Pain, fear or harm</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Most couples have arguments and fights, but this does not necessarily mean
  your relationship is unhealthy. However , when one person is feeling unsafe or
  afraid in the relationship, this is usually a sign that there are serious
  problems. It is a good idea to regularly assess your relationship using the
  scales below.
