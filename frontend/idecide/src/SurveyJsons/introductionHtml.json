We will then provide an action plan based on your situation, which will include resources and recommendations aimed at assisting you in your situation.</p>\n<p>If you need to quickly exit the site and clear all data, use the 'quick exit' button in the top right (try using it now before you start!). Note that this option will clear all data on your device, and so you'll need to start any modules which had not been saved over again.</p>\n<p>If you cannot finish all of the modules in one sitting, use the 'save progress' that you will see on the next page. Once you have created an account, your progress will be automatically saved for you to continue later (in case you didn't finish all modules), or review your action plan.</p>\n<p><em>When you are ready to continue, please press the 'Begin New Session' button below.</em></p>"
